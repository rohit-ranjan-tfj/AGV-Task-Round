Two prediction equations:

    State Extrapolation Equation - prediction or estimation of the future state, based on the known present estimation.
    Covariance Extrapolation Equation - the measure of uncertainty in our prediction.

Two update equations:

    State Update Equation - estimation of the current state, based on the known past estimation and present measurement.
    Covariance Update Equation - the measure of uncertainty in our estimation.

Kalman Gain Equation â€“ required for computation of the update equations. The Kalman Gain is actually a "weighting" parameter for the measurement and the past estimations. It defines the weight of the past estimation and the weight of the measurement in estimating the current state.
